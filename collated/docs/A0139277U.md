### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br> 
> Figure 1: Architecture of the App<br>

Figure 1 above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[*Main*]() has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/MainApp.java).<br>
It interacts with the different components at 2 specific parts of the App life cycle:

* On app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* On exit: Shuts down the components and saves the activity manager.

> Figure 9: Sequence Diagram in Logic of add command<br>

Figure 9 above shows the additional steps required by the `AddCommand` to parse its arguments. `ActivityParser` class to parse the user's command. The `ActivityParser` uses the `AddParser` class to parse argument for `AddCommand`. After the additional parsing, it creates a `Command` object and continues on in the same steps as the other commands.

#### Use Case : List

**MSS**

1. User enters list command followed by the addition filters of the listing.
2. Menion displays the list of activities according to the filters input by the user.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The filter input by the User is not valid.
> 1a1. Menion prints out error message and requests for another input.<br>
> 1a2.  Repeat step 1a1 until user inputs a valid filter for the list command.

1b. User requests for Menion to list all the Activity.
> 1b1. Menion shows a list of all the Activities in the Menion.<br>
> 1b2. Resume to step 2 in MSS.

1c. User requests for Menion to list all Activity of a specified date / week / month.
> 1c1. Menion shows a list of all the Activities in the Menion which has a deadline of the specified date.<br>
> 1c2. Resume to step 3 in MSS.

> * Has beautiful user interface.<br>
> * Able to be used offline.<br>
> * Able to sync across platforms when online.

_Cons_
> * No one shot approach of typing details of activity into a command line.<br>
> * Requires a lot of mouse clicking.
