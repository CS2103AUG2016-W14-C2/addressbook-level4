#### Use Case : Delete Activity

**MSS**

1. User enters command followed by the activity type and the indices of the Activities to be deleted.
2. Menion does a search through the database and deletes the Activities.
3. Menion displays the list of Activity left in the database.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The indices input by the user is not in the range of indices available.

> 1a1. Menion prompts user to re-input the indices of the Activities.<br>
> 1a2. User reinputs the indices of the Activities.<br>
> Repeat 1a1 - 1ab until user inputs valid indices of the Activities.<br>
> Use case resumes at step 2.

```

#### Use Case: Find

**MSS**

1. User enters find command followed by the keywords of the search.
2. Menion performs the find command.
3. Menion displays the details of the Activities with names/notes containing the keywords.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. There is no Activity with the keyword stated.
> 2a1. Menion displays '0 activities listed!' message.<br>
> Use case ends.

## Introduction
Ever felt overwhelmed from the multitude of tasks you have to complete and have no idea where to start? Are you looking for an easy to work with application to help you track all your activities? Well look no further! Your very own Menion is here to assist you!

Menion is your personal assistant that tracks all your activities and displays them in a simple to read display. It saves you the hassle of remembering what needs to be done and is able to help you prioritise your tasks.

Unlike other complicated task managers, Menion is simple and intuitive. It relies completely on the keyboard and only requires a single line of command. This removes the inconvenience of clicking and navigating through multiple interfaces for you. It also has a flexible command interface, and is able to accept variations of the same command, removing the need to memorise a certain format for every command. 

Let's get started!
## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
2. Download Menion: You can download Menion.jar from the latest release here: 
   [Menion.jar]()
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for  Menion.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. <br><br>

5. Type the command in the command box as shown in Figure 1 and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing `help` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
6. Some example commands you can try:

	* `add Assignment 2 by: TASK_DEADLINE_DATE TASK_DEADLINE_TIME n: NOTES`
   * `list all`: lists all activities
   * `delete event 3` : deletes the 3rd event shown in the current list
   * `exit` : exits the app
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>
