## Introduction
Ever felt overwhelmed from the multitude of tasks you have to complete and have no idea where to start? Are you looking for an easy to work with application to help you track all your activities? Well look no further! Your very own Menion is here to assist you!

Menion is your personal assistant that tracks all your activities and displays them in a simple to read display. It saves you the hassle of remembering what needs to be done and is able to help you prioritise your tasks.

Unlike other complicated task managers, Menion is simple and intuitive. It relies completely on the keyboard and only requires a single line of command, removing the inconvenience of clicking and navigating through multiple interfaces. It also has a flexible command interface, accepting many variations of the same command, removing the need to memorise a certain format for every command. Let's get started!
## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
2. Download Menion: You can download Menion.jar from the latest release here:

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for  Menion.
