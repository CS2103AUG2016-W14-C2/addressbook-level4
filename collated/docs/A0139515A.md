### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
> Figure 4: UI component<br>

API : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts. 
For example, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ActivityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc... All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

`ActivityListPanel` consists of three different activities lists whhich are `taskViewList`, `eventViewList` and `floatingTaskViewList`. Activities in each list is displayed `TaskCard`, `EventCard` and `FloatingTaskCard` respectively.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)<br>
 `SceneBuilder` is the main tool that is used to create `.fxml` files.

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component by passing in strings that are captured by `CommandBox`.
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* retrieves the three different lists from `Logic` at the start of the session.
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly. e.g. `ModifyStoragePathCommand` raise an event that leads to update of storage path in the status bar. (refer to figure 5)

> Figure 11: Sequence Diagram in Logic of undo command<br>

Figure 11 above shows how `UndoCommand` makes use of the model to retrieve the previous activity manager.
`UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` make use of two stacks in `Model` which stores different states of `ReadOnlyActivityManager`. When there is a command that causes modification to `ReadOnlyActivityManager`, a copy of the state of `ReadOnlyActivityManager` before the modification will be pushed into the undo stack. Calling `UndoCommand` will cause a pop from the undo stack and the state will be pushed into the redo stack. Similarly, calling `RedoCommand` will cause a pop from redo stack and the state will be pushed back into the undo stack. This allows the application to jump around different states of `ReadOnlyActivityManager`.

#### Use Case : Undo

**MSS**

1. User enters undo command.
2. Menion reverts back to the state of the previous command.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. There is no previous command available to undo.

> 1a1. Menion prompts user to enter another command.<br>
> 1a2. Use case ends.

#### Use Case : Modify Storage Path
**MSS**

1. User requests to modify the storage path.
2. Menion prompts user to key in new desired storage path.
3. User types in the new desired storage path.
4. Menion updates the new storage path.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The given storage path is invalid.
> 2a1. Menion shows an error message.<br>
> Use case resumes at step 2.
