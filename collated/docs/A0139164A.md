API : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/logic/Logic.java)

 [`Logic`](../src/main/java/seedu/menion/logic/Logic.java) uses the `ActivityParser` class to parse the user's command. Some commands such as the `AddCommand` and the `EditCommand` use additional `Parser` classes to help further parse the arguments. They result in a `Command` object being created and executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an Activity) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

> Figure 10: Sequence Diagram in Logic of edit command<br>

Figure 10 above shows how `EditCommand` requires an additional step in parsing. `ActivityParser` class passes the user's input to the `EditParser` class to parse the command properly. After parsing, it will return a new `Command` object being created and executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. editting an Activity) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`. This is similar to the `AddCommand`.

*Logging Levels* can be classified as follows: 

* `SEVERE`: It is a critical problem that may cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING`: It is a problem which may allow the application to continue to run but do so with caution.
* `INFO`: It is a noteworthy action by the App.
* `FINE`: It may not be noteworthy, but may be useful in debugging.

> 1a1. Menion prompts user to re-enter Activity.<br>
> 1a2. User inputs a new task.<br>
> Repeat 1a1 - 1a2 until user inputs the correct format.<br>
> Use case resumes at step 2.

#### Use Case : Edit Activity

**MSS**

1. User enters edit command followed by the name of the Activity to be edited, it's index, the parameter that is to be edited, and the changes to be made.
2. Menion displays the updated information of the Activity.

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. The index of the Activity entered by the user does not exist.

> 1a1. Menion prompts user to re-input index of the Activity.<br>
> 1a2. User re-inputs the index of Activity.<br>
> Repeat 1a1 - 1a2 until the user inputs a valid index of Activity.<br>
> Use case resumes at step 2.

1b. The information entered by the user does not follow the format.

> 1b1. Menion prompts user to re-input edit command of the Activity in the given format.<br>
> 1b2. User re-inputs edit command of the Activity.<br>
> Repeat 1b1 - 1b2 until the user inputs a valid format of edit command for the Activity.<br>
> Use case resumes at step 2.
